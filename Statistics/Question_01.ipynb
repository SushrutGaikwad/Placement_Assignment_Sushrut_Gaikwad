    "**Question 1: A university wants to understand the relationship between the SAT scores of its applicants and their college GPA. They collect data on 500 students, including their SAT scores (out of 1600) and their college GPA (on a 4.0 scale). They find that the correlation coefficient between SAT scores and college GPA is 0.7. What does this correlation coefficient indicate about the relationship between SAT scores and college GPA?**"

    "**Answer:** The correlation coefficient of 0.7 is positive and is closer to 1. This indicates a strong positive correlation between SAT scores and college GPA. In other words, whenever SAT scores increase, the college GPA also increases."
